Little paper I wrote about trie data structure and how it can be used to implement associative array in C++.

1. All code for trie is in src/trie.h
2. Container class for ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY is in assoc_array.h
3. For full paper see doc/raport.tex
4. src/trie.cpp is the sandbox-testing file. Feel free to remove it.
